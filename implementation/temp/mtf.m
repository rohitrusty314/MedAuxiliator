Tested using Matlab 7.7.0.471 (R2008b)
including the imaging toolbox on a mac using OSX 10.5.8
 
A Gaussian fitting tool has been used in this code. You can download this 
tool on the Matlab central website here: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11733-gaussian-curve-fit
 
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Notes on Script%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
General comments:
 
This code can be used to measure the pre-sampled MTF of an image, which is a 
quantity that describes the resolution of linear imaging system. The code
is based on measuring the pre-sample MTF using a precision machined 
edge that is aligned - with respect to the columns or rows of an image - 
at an angle between 1-5 degrees.  
 
To learn more about the pre-sampled MTF consult the references at the end
of this script.

When you run this script your image containing the edge with appear with the 
cropping tool. Crop your image to the region containing only the edge. 
Double-click your cropped area for the script to continue. 


Samei, Flynn, and Reimann (Ref.2 ) have a good description on how to 
fabricate the edge to measure the pre-sampled MTF.

% of edge spread distances.

% span is used to smooth the edge spread function 
% Samei, Flynn, and Reimann (Ref.2 ) use a forth weighted,
% Gaussian-weighted moving polynomial.

% Used to improve the location of the edge
 
boundplusminus = 2; 
% boundplusminus is a variable that is used to crop a small section of the
% edge in order to used to find the subpixel interpolated edge position.

% boundplusminus_extra incorperates addition pixel values near the edge to
