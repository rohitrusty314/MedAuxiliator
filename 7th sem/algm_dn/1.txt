 Abstract—For about two decades scientists have been 
developing techniques for enhancing the quality of medical images 
using Fourier transform, DWT (Discrete wavelet transform),PDE 
model etc., Gabor wavelet on hexagonal sampled grid of the images 
is proposed in this work. This method has optimal approximation 
theoretic performances, for a good quality image. The computational 
cost is considerably low when compared to similar processing in the 
rectangular domain. As X-ray images contain light scattered pixels, 
instead of unique sigma, the parameter sigma of 0.5 to 3 is found to 
satisfy most of the image interpolation requirements in terms of high 
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) , lower Mean Squared Error 
(MSE) and better image quality by adopting windowing technique. 
Keywords—Hexagonal lattices, Gabor filter, Interpolation, image 
processing. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
- RAY image enhancement is the process of enhancing 
edges progressively until optimal levels of clarity are 
reached in the x-ray image. Basically the edge segments of the 
image are enhanced by making its light parts lighter and its 
dark parts darker along the edges, preserving interior textures 
at their original gray level values. An interactive system was 
employed in [1] which enhances a digital radiogram, giving 
the radiologist a refined image on which to base a diagnosis. 
In [2], a local adaptive image enhancement and simultaneous 
denoising algorithm for fulfilling the requirements of digital 
X-ray image enhancement is introduced. An approach to 
image enhancement of digital chest radiographs is described 
by Du-Yih TSAI and Katsuyuki KOJIMA [3]. The method is 
to employ various non-linear mapping functions to different 
scale levels at the transform domain. The mapping functions 
are used to project a set of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) 
coefficients to a new set of DWT coefficients. In [4], a new 
method for contrast enhancement of MR brain images was 
proposed using a canonical correlation based kernel 
independent component analysis (KICA). The method 
presented for enhancing medical images generated from Xrays 
in [5] is based on a nonlinear partial differential equation 
(PDE) model, Kramer’s PDE model. M. Dirk Robinson [6]

reconstructed images for enhancing digital mammogram 
images. Thus, for about two decades scientists have been 
developing techniques for processing pictorial information by 
means of digital computers with various techniques and 
algorithms. All these works are based on the images on 
rectangular Grid. The work proposed in this paper is based on 
hexagonal sampling grid to process the enhancement of 
medical images as it has many features. 
Since Golay [7], the possibility of using a hexagonal 
structure to represent digital images and graphics has been 
studied by many researchers [8-14]. Hexagonal grid of pixels 
can be represented on the existing rectangular screens for 
modeling and processing purpose, which is more suitable for 
computer vision modeling [15]. Manipulating data sampled 
on one lattice to produce data sampled on a different lattice is 
termed as resampling. In this approach, the original data is 
sampled on a square lattice while the desired image is to be 
sampled on a hexagonal lattice (Figure.1) 
Fig. 1 Acquisition of hexagonally sampled images 
The resampling method used in this paper is as follows. For 
each odd line, find the midpoint between two adjacent pixels 
by simple linear interpolation (i.e., mid = (left + right) / 2) 
[16]. Discard the left and right, keeping only the mid values. 
This gives us a hexagonal mapping from a regular square or 
rectangular grid. The procedure is as follows: 
p new ( x ,2 y ) = p old (x ,2 y) (1) 
pnew(x,2y+1) = (pold (x,2y+1)+ pold(x+1,2y+1))/ 2 (2) 
During the acquisition of the images from rectangular 
lattice to the hexagonal lattice, it was observed that there is a 
considerable loss in image quality [Fig.2(a)].So, selection of 
suitable interpolation technique is needed before processing 
the image. Image reconstruction through interpolation is

routine task in image processing during all transformation that 
is made on an image. Such transformations include scaling, 
rotation, registration, and edge detection. Considerable 
interest on hexagonal sampling is shown recently due to the 
interest in human vision systems , some of the image 
acquisition systems using hexagonally laid pixels, imaging 
radars and nuclear medicine. They also possess better 
topological and geometrical properties, resulting in a more 
efficient signal representation in two dimensions [17]. 
Images are generally constructed out of discrete sample 
points and if the fitted function is band limited, the signal can 
be reconstructed using interpolation by a Sinc-function, which 
is a low pass filter in the frequency domain. Ideally this 
interpolator should not create any artifacts on the resultant 
interpolation, but it introduces artifacts due to its truncation or 
by windowing for computational economics. This has 
prompted scientists to explore compactly supported 
interpolating functions which are approximations to obtain a 
perfect reconstruction. It has also a filtering effect as some 
noise components get suppressed during reconstruction. Much 
work is available for interpolation in rectangular lattices using 
parameterized wavelets and piecewise polynomial functions, 
the most important being that is using B - Splines [18]. B - 
Spline methods enable approximation in a simple way using 
the orthogonal properties of B - Splines. In hexagonal grid, 
three methods namely, box splines, hex-splines and 
generalized splines of maximal order and minimum support 
are proposed [19-26]. The first one exploits the six fold 
symmetry and the second, twelve fold symmetry. However the 
third one is a generalization to get best results out of an 
interpolation with a trade off between the interpolated result 
and computational complexity. This is achieved from error 
minimization using the spectral components with an 
assumption that the signal energy is concentrated over the 
low-frequency region. A method employing Gabor filters is 
proposed on the hexagonal lattice to get enhanced quality 
image reconstruction with some extra computational power. 
For analysis, windowing technique is used which yields 
improved results. 
II. GABOR FILTERS 
A. Overview of Gabor filters 
Gabor filters have desirable properties for picture analysis 
and feature extraction: They are selective in space, spatial 
frequency and orientation , achieving the theoretical limit for 
conjoint resolution in the spatial and spatial frequency domain 
[27]. Therefore, they have been widely used in these fields in 
recent years [28-31]. Those filters were also used to describe 
the behavior of simple cells in area V1 of the human visual 
cortex, which has turned out to be very successful [32]. Hubel 
and Wiesel [33] found simple cells in a cat’s visual cortex, 
which was sensitive to frequency and orientation of an image 
perceived. Experiments revealed that a Gabor filter takes the 
form of a Gaussian modulated complex sinusoid in the spatial 
domain. The standard definition proposed by B. S. Manjunath 
and W. Y. Ma [34] is used (Equation 3).A two dimensional 
Gabor function g(x, y) and its Fourier transform G(u, v) can be 
written as:

 B.Importance of windowing 
Usually, it is not possible to process all the samples of a 
signal simultaneously. The signal is processed in reduced 
segments, chosen with an analysis window. By choosing a 
size of an adopted window, we can generally observe that the 
signal is stationary during the duration of the analysis period. 
Apodization windows are often used in signal processing to 
reduce the ill effects of finite processing windows. The 
windowed signal Xw (k) is thus represented as the product of 
the signal and of the weighted window: 
Xw (k) = x (k).w(k) 
Where x (k) is the signal to be analyzed and w(k) the 
weighting or temporal window of null value outside the 
observation interval. This temporal product is transformed in 
the frequency domain by a convolution product of the Fourier 
transforms of the sequence and window. A window is needed 
which does not suddenly cut off the signal at its edges, but 
rather one which smooths the signal gradually down to zero at 
its edges. One candidate for this is selected as the Hanning 
window [35 ]. This is defined by

III COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS 
A.Gabor Filter Bank 
The filter bank was carried out with six orientations as 0º, 30º, 
60º, 90º, 120º and 150º and three radial frequency values: F = 
(0.3536, 0.1768 and 0.0884). This leaves us with a total of 18 
filters that cover the frequency domain. Different standard 
deviation values of the Gaussian curve were tested, those 
being the three values used in the study s g = (2.91, 5.82 and 
11.64) [Equation (3)].

Next the filter bank was carried out with three orientations 00 
, 600 and 1200. The filter bank was applied to the hexagonal 
sampled images e.g chestxray.tif - Figure 2(b) which is of 
poor quality obtained for the input image shown in Figure 
2(a).Half pixel shift method for the acquisition of hexagonal 
lattice from rectangular lattice is used as reported in our 
earlier paper [36-37].

The image resulting from the filtering process is shown in 
Figure 6(b) with clarity in the image. The results show that 
that the proposed methodology works effectively with any 
complete directional decomposition.

C. Gabor kernel with windowing technique 
Fig. 7 shows the Gabor kernel with Hanning window 
discussed in section II-B. Figure .8 shows the response of 
image obtained by convolving the kernel of Figure.7 . With 
the effect of window, image is free from spurious shading and 
features of the image is very clear compared with the original 
image. The results show that the obtained image quality is 
better, smoothed and the orientations/edges are very clear 
(Figure. 9). Performance measures in terms of Peak Signal-to- 
Noise ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were 
analysed and listed in Table.1 which shows marginal 
improvement with hexagonal lattice than the rectangular 
lattice when operating the Gabor filter on the image. For 
sigma value between 0.5 to 3 better results are obtained in 
terms of high PSNR and lower MSE values. Generally s = 
0.75, s = 1.5, s = 3 for simple, medium and large simple cell 
width respectively [39].

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
We have proposed an implementation of Gabor filters on the 
hexagonal lattice for resampling and interpolation. In an 
earlier paper [37, 38], the benefits of hex Gabor filters were 
reported for the purpose of filtering, edge detection and 
registration. In this paper the parameter sigma` from 0.5 to 3 is 
found to satisfy most of the image interpolation requirements 
as per the results obtained in previous section. For reflected 
images, we can get enhancement with a unique value of 
sigma. The X-ray image analysis shows that this is not true for 
images that contain light scattered pixels. 
Interpolation methods using hexsplines and other 
interpolating functions have a smoothing effect on the image, 
whereas Gabor three orientation windowed filter show that the 
edges are better preserved, while keeping the low frequency 
information intact. It gives best results for the texture images. 
Therefore this method is ideal for generation of medical atlas 
from MRI images and for high definition TV. 
The image quality obtained with Gabor filter has superior 
visual quality over their spline counterparts over the 
hexagonal lattice, leading to high-quality visualization of 
images (see Figure 6, 9 ). Notice that the hazy edges are 
modified to very sharp boundaries.
